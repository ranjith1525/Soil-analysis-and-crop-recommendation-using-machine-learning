## Introduction

The Crop Prediction Web Application aims to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions about crop selection based on key soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate crop recommendations, enhancing agricultural productivity and resource management.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy to use with a simple input form for soil parameters.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts the most suitable crop for given soil conditions using Random Forest.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides users with recommendations and accepts feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices including smartphones and tablets.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Deployment:** Flask server
